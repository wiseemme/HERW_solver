# Hand-Eye Robot World Solver

This repository contains a version of the Hand-Eye Robot-World solver for "Accurate calibration of multi-perspective cameras from a generalization of the hand-eye constraint" by Wang et al.
The dockerfile can be used to create a container for running the code.

I extended the method to estimate multiple X and Y poses.

# To do:
- Implement a sparse smallest eigen value solver.
